    Gold nanoislands may be formed by annealing a substrate -- on which gold has been uniformly deposited -- to produce islands within a predictable range of size and shape.
    
    This research attempts to characterizes the reproducibility of gold nano-island morphology using the polymer-assisted deposition and self-assembly method.
    
    Prior research suggests that the physical properties of gold nano-islands are sensitive to the method of depositing the gold, the number of layers, and variations in annealing temperature \cite{shon11}.

    [The LSPR absorption features of colloidal gold are shown by Kedem and Rubinstein (2011 acs) [add to bibtex, make sure it's original research]

 [there is more research to cite here -- lots of study of self-assembled islands from evaporative deposition by Van Duyne and his chain of relevant citations show properties vs. size et cetera, and I should find the proper method of citing other people's figures].  


    Gold nano-island formation through polymer-assisted self-assembly is also sensitive to the initial size of the colloidal gold used to form the self-assembling layers \\cite(reference), to the temperature profile during annealing, and to the length of time (in days) between creation and annealing (\cite{joshi}).

    [ more junk to clean up -- if I analyze how the polymer-deposited samples decay in air, it'll be done near the end of my research and be given a single paragraph and one figure ]
    
    This research quantifies the repeatiblity of gold nano-islands produced using the label-free(*) self-assembly method.

    Plasmonic nanoparticles also act as transducers that convert small changes in the local refractive index into spectral shifts in the intense nanoparticle extinction and scattering spectra. 
    Most organic molecules have a higher refractive index than buffer solution; thus, when they bind to nanoparticles, the local refractive index increases, causing the extinction and scattering spectrum to redshift. 
    Molecular binding can be monitored in real time with high sensitivity by using simple and inexpensive transmission spectrometry, which measures extinction, the sum of absorption and scattering 3,8-10,41,42.

    Thus, changes in the local environment - such as through the presence of an adsorbed species - should cause a shift in $\lambda_max$ .

    \subsection{The Chemistry of Self-Assembling Films}

    \emph{COMMENT: This section is based on discussion with YS Shon, and attribution should be made for these ideas.}
    
    Gold self-assembling films were produced from two sizes of gold particle.  
    The larger particles were Au$_{314}$, the smaller were Au$_{25}$.  
    These particles are coated in different organic ligands, which aid their solubility in ethanol (in the case of Au$_{314}$) and water (in the case of Au$_{25}$).    
    The ligands are terminated with a carboxy group (COOH) in ethanol and aqueous solutions; in the aqueous Au$_{25}$ solution, ligands may also be terminated with a positively charged carboxy group (COO-). 
    
    After the first gold layer is deposited the sample is dipped in an aqueous solution of poly(allyl-amine hydrochloride) (PAH).  
    The PAH bonds to the ligands and allows the next layer to assemble.      
    The aqueous PAH molecules are terminated with amine groups (NH$_2$) and with positively charged amine groups (NH$_3^+$).  
    The relative occurrence of the NH$_3^+$ groups determine the pH of the solution.
    
    In the aqueous Au$_{25}$ solution, the PAH NH$_3^+$ group favorably bonds to the ligand COOH and COO- groups.
    The density of the single self-assembled gold layer therefore depends (non-linearly) on the pH of the PAH solution, with lower pH (higher ratio of NH$_3^+$ groups) resulting in higher packing density.
    The effect of pH on Au$_{25}$ layer density may be studied in this or another paper.
    
    In the ethanol Au$_{314}$ solution, there is an absence of ligand COO- groups.
    A more neutral pH of the PAH solution allows more bonds between NH$_2$ and COOH groups.
    
    \subsection{A model of gold density in Au$_{314}$ and Au$_{25}$ films}
    The difference in gold density between self-assembling Au$_{314}$ and Au$_{25}$ films can be visually observed.
    In previous unpublished study, an gold film formed from 8-layers of self-assembled Au$_{25}$ was equivalent in color to a Au$_{314}$ film of approximately 2-4 layers.
    
    The relationship between color and gold film thickness is a well-documented one, for uniform gold thin films deposited by evaporation, but the color of nano-island films also depend on morphology.
    The color of nano-island phonons depend not just on thickness, but also size and shape of the islands \cite{link99} (cite VanDuyne paper that shows islands up to $99{\mu}m$ diameter and their resulting LSPR absorption peaks).
    The size and shape of nano-islands depends on factors that include the initial size of the colloidal gold.
    
    The following comparison of gold density for Au$_{314}$ films of 2-4 layers versus Au$_{25}$ films 8 layers therefore contains a simplified interpretation of the observed color match.  
    We nominally assume that the match of visually observed color implies that the two films, created from the annealing of differently-sized gold particles, are similar in nano-island thickness, shape, and size.
    
    With this assumption in place, a first-order approximation of the relative gold density of Au$_{314}$ and Au$_{25}$ films requires two additional assumptions.
    First, the average length of the ligands are assumed to be fixed (we neglect that these ligands can easily stretch or shrink).
    Also, the effect of the pH in the PAH solution on packing density should be considered a second-order effect until demonstrated otherwise.    
    
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=60mm]{images/willitblend-big.eps}
        \includegraphics[width=50mm]{images/willitblend.eps}
        \caption{layered gold may be modeled as packed spheres whose packing density depends on radius (approximated) and amount of gold deposited per sphere (known).}
        \label{f:packed_spheres}
    \end{figure}
    Figure \ref{f:packed_spheres} [image in which the gold particles are modeled as packed spheres]    
    
    The approximate ligand length is 2${\mu}m$ for Au$_{314}$ and approximately 1${\mu}m$ for Au$_{25}$.
    The approximate size of the colloidal gold particles are 2.5${\mu}m$ for Au$_{314}$ and 1${\mu}m$ for Au$_{25}$.
    Making the assumption that these particles can be modeled as spheres of radius 3${\mu}m$ for Au$_{314}$ and 1.5${\mu}m$ for Au$_{25}$ leads to a relative density of 4 nanoparticles of Au$_{25}$ per nanoparticle of Au$_{314}$, which yields an approximate density of 100/314.
    
    At the first order, three times more layers of Au$_{25}$ should therefore be deposited to yield an equivalent gold mass to the Au$_{314}$ film.
    
    In real application, thermolysis of much more than 8 layers of a film will result in defects of significant density to affect the production of our nanoislands of interest.
    To produce a thicker film, it is therefore better to use larger Au$_{314}$ particles instead of many layers of Au$_{25}$.


    \subsection{Size and Shape Distributions and Phonon Absorption Features}
    The uniformity of the size and shape is expected to correlate with the width of the absorption feature of the resulting sample.
    A wider distribution of sizes and shapes is expected to produce a broader absorption peak, while a narrower distribution of nanoisland sizes about the average size is expected to produce a sharper absorption feature.
    This relationship is predicted analytically because identical islands should absorb identically (neglecting second-order effects), producing a maximized peak.  
    Differences among the islands will create phonons that are offset by some amount from the peak wavelength, resulting in a lower and broader peak.

    Measurements of colloidal gold (Figure \ref{f:link99} \cite{link99}) show that peak depends on size and shape [lots of van duyne citations or citations to his original sources].
    
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=150mm]{images/link99.eps}
        \caption{Measurements of colloidal gold show a peak absorption dependant on size.  A wider distribution of sizes or shapes will produce broadening due to different wavelength centers.  This or another article included a table characterizing shape uniformity which would better illustrate.}
        \label{f:link99}
    \end{figure}
        

    \subsection{How to Evaluate the Reproducibility of Nano-Island Samples}
    The effectiveness of our process control can be evaluated through direct and indirect measurement of the uniformity of the resulting nano-islands.  
    Nano-island size and uniformity can be measured directly through atomic force microscope (AFM) images.  
    Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images may also be used to evaluate size and uniformity, but these SEM was limited to a $10\mu$m minimum window, and could not evaluate the smallest nano-islands (size below {\bf $50nm$ (TBR)}).  
    
    
    Spectral measurements of the nano-island samples will show absorption features which can be used, along with the direct measurements, to indirectly indicate the uniformity of the size distribution of the nano-islands.
    
    \begin{quote}
        Because there is inherent heterogeneity among individual nanoparticles, each LSPR spectrum is different, revealing the true distribution of resonance wavelengths (20, 98).

    \section{Temperature Control, Measurement, and Errors}

    In-situ measurements require the measurement of temperature and impedance.  
    The impedance is measured at the sample, while the temperature is inferred from thermocouple measurments.
    Temperature measurments with more than one thermocouple showed that fast heating is uneven across the furnace.  
    Also, during fast heating, impedance measurements of a bare electrode did not match their expected temperature dependance, when the temperature was measured with a nearby 10-mil bare wire K-type thermocouple in air.
    The glass of the electrode caused the sample temperature to lag up to $100^{\circ}C$ behind the air temperature during fast heating.

    \section{Gold Nano Island Preparation}    

    \subsection{Preparing Gold Slides}
    
    \subsubsection{Preparation of Gold Nanoparticle Solution}
    The preparation of the gold nanoparticle solution requires about a week of preparation to yield the 10 mL of Au$_{314}$.
    

    \subsubsection{Layering the Samples}
    To deposit the self-assembling multilayers on a glass electrode, the following steps are 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First Day
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An aqueous solution of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) is prepared, adding 10mg PAH to 10mL nanopure water, for use on Day Three.
            \item 1.0mL methanol is added to 0.1mL triethyl 3-mercaptopropylsilane in a 5mL vial.
            \item 0.1mL of nanopure water is added to the solution.  (The triethyl 3-mercaptopropylsilane will react with the water and the solution becomes cloudy).
            
            \item The IDE is placed in the solution for 24 hours.
            \item \emph{Note}: it is important not to leave the IDE for more than 24 hours, or the IDE will acquire a thick deposited coating.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Second Day
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The IDEs are placed in clean 5mL vials.
            \item Methanol is added to the vials and the samples are sonicated in an ultrasonic bath.
            \item The methanol wash is removed, and the washing process is repeated 2 more times.
            \item After the third ultrasonic wash, the samples are gently dried under a stream of nitrogen gas or air.
            \item After drying, gold nanoparticle solution is added to each vials, enough to cover the IDE.
            \item The IDEs are left in the nanoparticle solution overnight.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Third Day
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A work station is prepared with an ultrasonic bath, Pasteur pipettes, nanopure water, ethanol, PAH solution, and several spare 20mL vials for containing waste or re-used liquids.
            \item for layer = 2:10 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The gold nanoparticle solution is removed from each vial using Pipette A and placed in a 20mL vial for reuse.
                \item A washing solution of nanopure water (Au$_{25}$) or ethanol (Au$_{314}$) is added to each vial using Pipette A, and the vials are placed in an ultrasonic bath.
                    \subitem Washing the IDE by inverting the vials is not recommended, as this breaks bonding wires.  An ultrasonic bath prevents damage to the wire bonds.
                \item If the nanoparticle solution is Au$_{314}$, the ethanol is removed with Pipette A, nanopure water added, and the vials are again placed in the ultrasonic bath.
                \item The nanopure water is removed from the vial (for Au$_{314}$ and Au$_{25}$) using Pipette A.
                \item The PAH solution is added to each vial using Pipette B and the vials are left to stand for 5 minutes.
                \item The PAH solution is removed from the vials using Pipette B,  nanopure water is added with Pipette B, the vials are placed in an ultrasonic bath, and the nanopure water is removed using Pipette B.
                \item If Au$_{314}$, then add ethanol using Pipette A and place the vial once more into the ultrasonic bath, and the ethanol is removed with Pipette A.
                \item If this layer is not the last layer, the Au$_{314}$ or Au$_{25}$) solution is added to the vials using Pipette A, and the vials are left to stand for 5 minutes.
            \end{itemize}
            \item end for loop (next layer)
            \item The IDEs are gently dried under a stream of nitrogen gas or air, and placed in a vacuum desiccator in the dark, for storage.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
