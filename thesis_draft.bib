"link99" is described by Van Duyne as "[an] Excellent review 
article on the size-dependent spectral properties of gold  nanoparticles."
This article has good pics of size vs peak for sizes of 
{9, 22, 48, 99} nanometers diameter.

"shon11" aka "Stability and Morphology of Gold Nanoisland Arrays" includes plot of grain size of the 5- and 8-layer nanoisland samples.  The size is about 15nm radius with a large distribution
(30nm diameter to compare to link99).
