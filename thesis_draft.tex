	\subsection{background}
	Gold nanoislands  are formed by annealing a substrate -- on which gold has been uniformly deposited -- to produce islands within a predictable range of size and shape.
	The uniformity of the size and shape can be inferred by the width of the absorption features in the resulting thin film.
	\subsection{purpose}
	This research attempts to create reproducible samples of gold nano-islands and study their morphology.
	Prior research suggests that the physical properties of gold nano-islands are sensitive to the method of depositing the gold, the number of layers, and variations in annealing temperature \cite{shon07}.  
	Gold nano-island formation through polymer-assisted self-assembly is also sensitive to the initial size of the colloidal gold used to form the self-assembling layers \\cite(reference), to the temperature profile during annealing, and to the length of time (in days) between creation and annealing (\cite{joshi}).
	This research quantifies the repeatiblity of gold nano-islands produced using the label-free(*) self-assembly method.
	\subsection{method}
	Samples are produced using polymer-assisted self-assembling monolayers.

	\section{Procedure}

	\subsection{Measurement of Complex Impedance}
	DC resistance measurements of the electrode show only its insulating properties, as the glass substrate is a poor conductor and the IDE is a weak capacitor, so AC resistance is measured.
	Sample resistance (a parallel AC resistance) is typically high for the sample under test, this resistance changes when the sample is heated and the polymers are burned off.  
	The parallel resistance may drop to under 100 ohms during the burn-off of the polymers, which requires a four-point measurement to compensate for the series resistance test lead impedance.
	A four-point measurement is necessary because the test leads have been reported (AD5933) to have up to kilo-ohm impedance when measuring low sample resistance.
	Using a AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES - U1732B would preclude a four-point measurement, but how much impedance is due to the test leads?
	with high restance and capacitance has not been done
	Prior measurement of AC resistance over frequency shows that behavior
	Measurement of complex impedance of the samples allows the
